# SentimentX
SentimentX is a machine learning web-based application that performs sentiment analysis on text and images. The application is built using Streamlit, TextBlob, Altair, Pandas, PIL, and NumPy libraries. The user can select one of three options from the menu: EmoText, Logs, and EmoVision.

In EmoText, the user enters text and the application predicts its sentiment. The sentiment score and message are displayed to the user, and the data is stored in a session state for future reference. The application also generates a graph showing the sentiment scores over time.

In Logs, the user can view the sentiment scores and messages for all the text entered in EmoText. The user can also download the data as a CSV file.

In EmoVision, the user uploads an image and the application performs sentiment analysis on it. The sentiment score and message are displayed to the user, and the data is stored in a session state for future reference.

The application is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing. The user interface includes a sidebar menu for easy navigation and a footer displaying the name of the developer. The application is suitable for anyone who wants to analyze the sentiment of text or images, such as social media managers, marketers, or researchers.
